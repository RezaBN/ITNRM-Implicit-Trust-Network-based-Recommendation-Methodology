# Implicit-Trust-Network-based Recommendation Methodology (ITNRM)

## Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the "Implicit-Trust-Network-based Recommendation Methodology" (ITNRM) developed by Reza Barzegar Nozari and Hamidreza Koohi [1]. ITNRM is a groundbreaking recommendation methodology designed to enhance recommender systems by leveraging a novel implicit trust-network construction method. This approach introduces significant innovations in terms of similarity estimation, confidence measurement, and opinion alignment assessment, ultimately aiming to improve recommendation accuracy.

## Key Contributions

Our research presents several key contributions to the field of recommender systems:

1. **Asymmetric Similarity Metric**: We introduce a novel asymmetric similarity metric based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and a distance metric, providing a more refined measure of user similarity.

2. **Confidence Measurement**: We define a new method for quantifying user confidence, enhancing our understanding of the reliability of user interactions.

3. **Identical Opinion Estimation**: We propose a novel method to estimate the degree of identical opinion between users, shedding light on the alignment of user preferences.

4. **Trust Network Construction**: We formulate a unique approach to determine trust levels between users and construct a trust network using the metrics of similarity, confidence, and identical opinion.

5. **Recommendation Strategy**: We develop a novel recommendation strategy that incorporates the trust network, leading to more personalized and accurate recommendations.

## ITNRM Methodology Overview

The ITNRM methodology consists of two main parts:

### A) Implicit-Trust-Network Construction Method

1. **Incipient Trust Network Formation**: In the first phase, an incipient implicit-trust-network is constructed by combining the novel similarity measure, confidence measure, and identical opinion measure, all introduced in our research.

2. **Trust Network Evaluation and Reconstruction**: In the second phase, the validity of the incipient implicit-trust-network is evaluated and then reconstructed into a telic implicit-trust-network, ensuring the trust network's accuracy.

### B) Combination Ranking Method for Recommendation

1. **Predicting Item Ratings**: We predict item ratings based on the user's trust network.

2. **Scoring Items**: Items are scored considering the target user's trust network.

3. **Ranking Items**: Items are ranked both by predicted ratings and scores separately.

4. **Final Ranking**: A final ranking is generated by combining the two rankings, and high-ranking items are recommended to the target user.

For a more detailed explanation of the various steps of the ITNRM approach, please refer to the published article, "Novel Implicit-Trust-Network-based Recommendation Methodology" [1].

## Code Overview

This Python script is designed to showcase the steps involved in implementing and evaluating a trust-based collaborative filtering algorithm for rating prediction based on the paper [1]. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of processes and functions in the code:

### Overall Processes Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the input data from a CSV file (`Data.csv`) that contains user-item ratings.
   - Extract unique user and movie IDs from the data.
   - Set the maximum and minimum rating values (`MaxRating` and `MinRating`).

2. **User-Item Matrix Creation:**
   - Create a user-item matrix using the loaded data. The matrix represents users' ratings for different items.

3. **Calculating Similarity, Confidence, and Identical Opinion Matrices:**
   - Calculate Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) matrix, which measures the similarity between users' rating patterns.
   - Calculate distance matrix, considering the Euclidean distance between users' rating vectors.
   - Calculate identical opinion matrix, measuring the similarity of opinions between users.

4. **Generating Incipient Trust Network:**
   - Combine the similarity, confidence, and identical opinion matrices to generate an incipient trust network.
   - This network represents the initial trust levels between users based on their similarity, confidence, and opinion alignment.

5. **Reconstructing Incipient Trust to Telic Trust:**
   - Propagate trust values in the incipient trust network using a formula based on direct trust.
   - Calculate telic trust values by combining the propagated trust values with trustees' precision.

6. **Preparing Evaluation Data:**
   - Split the user-item matrix into training and test sets using K-Fold cross-validation (K=5).
   - Convert the training and test data into numpy arrays.
   - Create a trust matrix for the test trustees.

7. **Evaluating Trust Network Performance:**
   - For each test user, calculate the predicted ratings based on their trustees' ratings and weights.
   - Compare predicted ratings with actual ratings to evaluate the trust network's performance.
   - Calculate precision, recall, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics.

8. **Printing Results:**
   - Display the runtime of the code execution.
   - Print the evaluation results, including precision, recall, MAE, and RMSE.

Please note that the current version of the code exclusively focuses on the implementation of the proposed method for constructing trust relationships and the relevant metrics, as described in the academic paper. The recommendation methodology part proposed in the paper is not included in this code version.

### Explanation of Main Functions

1. **create_user_item_df(df)**

   - **Role**: This function takes as input a DataFrame (df) containing user-item interactions (e.g., user ratings for movies) and transforms it into a user-item matrix.
   - **Functionality**: It pivots the input DataFrame to create a user-item matrix where rows represent users, columns represent items, and the matrix elements represent user-item interactions (ratings). It fills in missing values with zeros.

2. **calculate_distance(user_item_matrix)**

   - **Role**: This function calculates the distance matrix between users based on their item ratings.
   - **Functionality**: It computes pairwise distances between users using Numba-compiled functions for efficient parallel processing. The distance is calculated based on the intersection of items rated by both users and the squared differences in their ratings.

3. **calculate_similarity(user_item_matrix)**

   - **Role**: This function calculates the similarity matrix between users.
   - **Functionality**: It uses the output from the `calculate_distance` function to compute the similarity matrix, which measures the similarity in item ratings between users. The function also calculates a similarity threshold for each user.

4. **calculate_confidence(user_item_matrix, similarity_dict)**

   - **Role**: This function calculates a confidence matrix reflecting the trust level between users.
   - **Functionality**: It uses the similarity information obtained from the `calculate_similarity` function to compute a measure of confidence in user relationships. The function determines the count of neighbors and common rated items between users to establish trust levels.

5. **calculate_identical_opinion(user_item_matrix, similarity_dict, confidence_dict)**

   - **Role**: This function calculates a matrix reflecting the extent to which users share identical opinions.
   - **Functionality**: It measures the sameness of opinions between users using Numba-compiled functions. The function considers the similarity, confidence, and item ratings when assessing the sameness of opinions.

6. **generate_incipient_trust(similarity_dict, confidence_dict, identical_opinion_dict)**

   - **Role**: This function constructs an initial trust network among users.
